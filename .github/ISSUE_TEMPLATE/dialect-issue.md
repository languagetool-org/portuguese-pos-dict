- `pt-PT-90`: European Portuguese, post-post-[agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Language_Orthographic_Agreement_of_1990);
`pt-PT-45`: European Portuguese, pre-post-[agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Language_Orthographic_Agreement_of_1990), also used for `pt-AO` and `pt-MZ`, viz. Angolan and Mozambican Portuguese.
