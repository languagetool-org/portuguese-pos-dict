# portuguese-pos-dict

This repository contains data and tools used to build dictionaries for Portuguese.

## Dictionaries

Portuguese has **two** separate sets of dictionaries, with separate source data and scripts to handle them:

- **[speller dictionaries](data/spelling-dict/README.md)**: those used by the `MORFOLOGIK_RULE_PT_*` spelling rules for
  all Portuguese varieties;
- **[POS tagger dictionary](data/src-dict/README.md)**: those used by LT's part-of-speech tagger to add POS information
  to each word.

For more in-depth information about each type, check their respective READMEs.

## Release

TBD
